## Reset IDM Activation / Trial
* Internet download manager provides a 30-day trial period, you can use this script to reset this Activation / Trial period whenever you want.

* The PowerShell method to run IAS is supported on Windows 8 and higher.

## Advanced Info
* To activate in unattended mode, run the script with the /act parameter.
* To freeze the trial in unattended mode, run the script with the /frz parameter.
* To reset in unattended mode, run the script with the /res parameter.

# How does it work?
* IDM stores the data related to trial and activation across various registry keys. Some of these keys are locked to protect them from tampering and data is stored in a pattern to track the fake serial issue and the remaining trial days. To activate it, the script here simply generates those registry keys by triggering a few downloads in IDM, identifies those registry keys, and locks them so IDM can’t edit and view them. That way IDM cannot show the warning that it’s activated with a fake serial key.
